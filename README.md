## Lab 1-Introduction to Continuous Integration

### Tasks

0. Source the virtual environment 'source /home/coder/venv/bin/activate'

1. Run the following steps of the 'Makefile':

'make lint'
'make format'
'make refactor'
'make test'

* Reflection Question: Why does refactor combine 'lint' and 'format'?

2. Run the following comand-line tool and then write a test for it using click test runner:

* Write a test for the 'add_cli' functionality of the 'main.py' function in the 'test_main.py' test file.
* Use the test for './main.py --help' as a guide.
* Reflection Question: How could you use this style of testing to build MLOps tools quickly?
